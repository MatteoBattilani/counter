# Counter
This project consists of a simple counter written in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. In addiction to the classic +1 and -1, it provides two main functions: 
- Automatic function: the counter increases by one every second (10.000 seconds is the maximum value).
- Timer function: the counter decreases until it reaches zero, with an interval of one second between each decrease. When zero is reached, an alarm sounds.

## Features

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `index.html`: the HTML file that includes the counter layout and links to the CSS and JavaScript files.
- `style.css`: the CSS file that includes the counter style.
- `script.js`: the JavaScript file that includes the counter and timer functionality.
- `audio/`: a folder that includes the audio file of the countdown alarm.
- `images/`: a folder that includes the favicon for the web page.
